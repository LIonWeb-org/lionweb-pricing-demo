* [x] we need https://github.com/LIonWeb-org/lioncore-mps/issues/33 to be fixed
* [ ] we need to be able to import correctly a LW model in Kolasu

Currently we are working on ensuring that we can associated the generated Kolasu classes to the LW Concepts they
originated from. We plan to do that by adding annotations.

We will then need to change the AST classes generators to add those annotations and produce the KolasuLanguage instance.

The KolasuLanguage instance would not know about the LW Language, so this mapping should be contained in some other
function that is generated and that is later invoked during unserialization, to register the mapping.

* [ ] we need a release of LionCore-MPS
* [ ] when running setup in the MPS module lioncore-mps is downloaded among the dependencies but not unzipped
* [x] issue loading the language (it cannot reseolve the meta-pointer to EnumerationLiteral)
* [ ] consider https://github.com/google/ksp/issues/1313
* [ ] run export of languages and models from command line, using ProjectLoader (https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-build-backends/blob/2ee0ec26d344effdfafc3c8000ade88f9cf3453c/project-loader/src/main/kotlin/de/itemis/mps/gradle/project/loader/ProjectLoader.kt#L16)
